        <div class="abstract-main">While the liquefaction susceptibility of fully saturated clean sands and their mixtures with low-plasticity fines has long been recognized in liquefaction engineering, gravelly soils were traditionally considered non-liquefiable due to their high pore pressure dissipation capacity, attributed to their larger grain sizes. However, with the increasing construction of gravelly earth fills, concerns about their liquefaction susceptibility have grown. Surprisingly, in these man-made earth fills, loose states were observed in some gravelly soil layers. The 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake (Mw = 7.9) provided case histories revealing that natural gravelly soils can also exist in a loose state and, furthermore, they can liquefy. To assess this, probabilistic case history-based liquefaction-triggering relationships have been developed. This paper discusses 65 available case histories of gravelly soil liquefaction, compiled from four earthquakes with magnitudes ranging from 6.5 to 9.2. It also explores the advantages of using alternative in-situ testing methods such as the dynamic penetration test (DPT), large penetration test (LPT), Becker penetration test (BPT), and geophysical surveys like shear wave velocity (Vs) rather than relying solely on the standard penetration test (SPT) and cone penetration test (CPT). Simplified procedures are employed to assess the liquefaction-triggering potential of gravelly soil layers. The assessment process begins with identifying the susceptible critical layer, estimating in-situ density, groundwater table depth, seismic intensity, and duration parameters, and considering grain size gradation characteristics, with an emphasis on addressing their uncertainties. The assessment results are presented in the cyclic stress ratio (CSR) vs. DPT blow count () domain. Based on the developed case history database, probability-based liquefaction-triggering boundary curves have been established for engineering practice. Finally, these curves are compared with existing probabilistic models found in the literature.</div>
        <div class="intro-main">Liquefaction can be defined as the reduction in shear strength and stiffness of saturated soils due to rapid cyclic loading, such as earthquakes or vibrating loads. Assessing the liquefaction potential of gravelly soils is essential for engineering practice. However, susceptibility to seismic soil liquefaction varies with soil type. Gravelly soils have often been incorrectly considered non-liquefiable (Tsuchida, 1970) due to their high capacity for pore pressure dissipation and the lack of case history data. Nevertheless, after the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, it became evident that loosely deposited gravelly soils are indeed susceptible to liquefaction. Following this earthquake, event and soil-type-specific seismic soil liquefaction curves were developed and presented by Cao et al. (2013) in the cyclic stress ratio (CSR) and dynamic penetration test resistance (') space. The reason for using the  capacity term for gravelly soils is that standard penetration test (SPT) and cone penetration test (CPT) results can be biased when applied to gravelly soils due to discrepancies in apparatus dimensions and grain size. Using relatively larger equipment like the dynamic penetration test (DPT) helps eliminate grain size effects in gravelly soils. While DPT apparatus had been used in China since the 1950s to correlate penetration resistance with bearing capacity for gravelly soils, researchers began employing it for seismic soil liquefaction assessments of gravelly soils. Consequently, new investigations were conducted for past earthquakes, such as the 1964 Alaska earthquake (Roy et al., 2022) or the 1976 Friuli earthquake (Rollins et al., 2020), to determine the capacity term. Furthermore, this method has been applied to recent earthquakes, such as the 2016 Ecuador earthquake (Lopez et al., 2018) or the 2010 Haiti earthquake (Olson et al., 2011), where surface manifestations of gravelly soil liquefaction were observed. Inspired by Cao et al. (2013), global assessments have been conducted recently by researchers (Rollins et al., 2021 and Pirhadi et al., 2022), utilizing case histories that include DPT measurements. Moreover, various researchers have conducted laboratory experiments to understand the liquefaction phenomenon in gravelly soils (Chang et al., 2014, Chang and Phantachang, 2016, etc.). Within the scope of this study, a protocol is implemented to assess the 65 DPT-based case histories. Using maximum likelihood methodology, probabilistic-based seismic soil liquefaction triggering curves are proposed.</div>

        <div class="para-1">Based on the gradation characteristics, the susceptibility of soil layers is assessed, and the loosest fully saturated soil layer is chosen as the critical layer. Subsequently, a protocol is developed for the selected critical layer to conduct an unbiased screening for all the case histories.

This apparatus consists of a larger cone with a diameter of 74 mm and an apex angle of 60 degrees, which is larger than that used in CPT, generating greater energy with a 120 kg hammer dropped from a height of 100 cm, in contrast to the SPT apparatus. These conditions allow for obtaining unbiased results, especially in gravelly soils. During the test, the number of blows is counted at 10 cm intervals and recorded as DPT blow counts (Cao et al., 2013). </div>

Similar to the SPT procedure, corrections based on energy levels and normalization due to overburden pressure must be applied to the DPT-Nin-situvalues. The conventional DPT system has an average hammer energy efficiency ratio of 89% (EDPT,avg). For all the case histories, a Pile Driving Analyzer (PDA) device is used to capture various hammer energy measurements (EDPT) during the test. It's worth noting that variations in the energy measurements are attributed to the variability in the rate of hammer drop (Cao et al., 2012). In-situ DPT-N values (Nin-situ) are corrected for energy efficiency following a similar procedure used in SPT (Rollins et al., 2021), as described in Equation 1. </div>

In recent years, various approaches have been developed by numerous researchers to create liquefaction triggering correlations for gravelly soils (Cao et al., 2013; Rollins et al., 2021 and 2022; Pirhadi et al., 2022).<br/>The aforementioned case history database is employed to develop liquefaction triggering correlations using the Maximum Likelihood Estimation (MLE) method, following the protocol suggested by Cetin (2000), which outlines specific formulations in detail. MLE shares a common goal with multidimensional "regression" analyses but offers advantages, such as a more appropriate treatment of aleatory uncertainties for separate contributing sources and the ability to monitor model parameters, including their interactions and covariances.<br/>The selection of a limit state function is of paramount importance when assessing overburden correction (Kσ), duration correction (), and grain size characteristics like gravel content (GC) within a unified framework. As part of the Maximum Likelihood Assessment, a limit state function described in Equation 6 is chosen, taking into account parameters suggested by Cetin et al. (2018). MLE enables the simultaneous assessment of liquefaction triggering relationships along with these corrections.</div>

The resulting liquefaction triggering boundary curves for 46 case histories are presented in Figure 2. A comparison between the suggested model by Rollins et al.

The assessment protocol outlines the steps taken for each case history to ensure an unbiased screening process. Additionally, the study highlights the significance of grain size effects in selecting the site investigation method, leading to the investigation of new case histories using the grain size effect-free DPT method.<br/>The study employs maximum likelihood models to assess the initiation of seismic soil liquefaction, resulting in the development of new liquefaction boundary curves. These new models offer improvements in the engineering assessment of the probability of seismic soil liquefaction initiation. The study addresses three key factors: i) magnitude (duration) effects, ii) gravel content (GC), and iii) effective overburden pressure effects.<br/>The maximum likelihood estimation (MLE) model demonstrates that GC content has a lesser impact compared to other parameters, leading to its exclusion from the modeling efforts. The final model establishes an unbiased foundation for evaluating liquefaction initiation, encompassing overall uncertainties.<br/>Comparison of these models underscores the challenge posed by the lack of case history data for gravelly soils, hindering probabilistic modeling efforts. Increasing the number of available case histories will be instrumental in enhancing modeling efforts, enabling engineers in practical applications to incorporate these insights into their projects.</div>
