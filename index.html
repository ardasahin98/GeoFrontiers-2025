        <h2 class="text">Abstract</h2>
        <p>
          While the liquefaction susceptibility of fully saturated clean sands
          and their mixtures with low-plasticity fines has long been recognized
          in liquefaction engineering, gravelly soils were traditionally
          considered non-liquefiable due to their high pore pressure dissipation
          capacity, attributed to their larger grain sizes. However, with the
          increasing construction of gravelly earth fills, concerns about their
          liquefaction susceptibility have grown. Surprisingly, in these
          man-made earth fills, loose states were observed in some gravelly soil
          layers. The 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake (Mw = 7.9) provided case
          histories revealing that natural gravelly soils can also exist in a
          loose state and, furthermore, they can liquefy. To assess this,
          probabilistic case history-based liquefaction-triggering relationships
          have been developed. This paper discusses 65 available case histories
          of gravelly soil liquefaction, compiled from four earthquakes with
          magnitudes ranging from 6.5 to 9.2. It also explores the advantages of
          using alternative in-situ testing methods such as the dynamic
          penetration test (DPT), large penetration test (LPT), Becker
          penetration test (BPT), and geophysical surveys like shear wave
          velocity (Vs) rather than relying solely on the standard penetration
          test (SPT) and cone penetration test (CPT). Simplified procedures are
          employed to assess the liquefaction-triggering potential of gravelly
          soil layers. The assessment process begins with identifying the
          susceptible critical layer, estimating in-situ density, groundwater
          table depth, seismic intensity, and duration parameters, and
          considering grain size gradation characteristics, with an emphasis on
          addressing their uncertainties. The assessment results are presented
          in the cyclic stress ratio (CSR) vs. DPT blow count () domain. Based
          on the developed case history database, probability-based
          liquefaction-triggering boundary curves have been established for
          engineering practice. Finally, these curves are compared with existing
          probabilistic models found in the literature.

          <h2>Introduction</h2>
          <p>
            Liquefaction can be defined as the reduction in shear strength and
            stiffness of saturated soils due to rapid cyclic loading, such as
            earthquakes or vibrating loads. Assessing the liquefaction potential
            of gravelly soils is essential for engineering practice. However,
            susceptibility to seismic soil liquefaction varies with soil type.
            Gravelly soils have often been incorrectly considered
            non-liquefiable (Tsuchida, 1970) due to their high capacity for pore
            pressure dissipation and the lack of case history data.
            Nevertheless, after the 2008 Wenchuan Earthquake, it became evident
            that loosely deposited gravelly soils are indeed susceptible to
            liquefaction. Following this earthquake, event and
            soil-type-specific seismic soil liquefaction curves were developed
            and presented by Cao et al. (2013) in the cyclic stress ratio (CSR)
            and dynamic penetration test resistance (') space. The reason for
            using the  capacity term for gravelly soils is that standard
            penetration test (SPT) and cone penetration test (CPT) results can
            be biased when applied to gravelly soils due to discrepancies in
            apparatus dimensions and grain size. Using relatively larger
            equipment like the dynamic penetration test (DPT) helps eliminate
            grain size effects in gravelly soils. While DPT apparatus had been
            used in China since the 1950s to correlate penetration resistance
            with bearing capacity for gravelly soils, researchers began
            employing it for seismic soil liquefaction assessments of gravelly
            soils. Consequently, new investigations were conducted for past
            earthquakes, such as the 1964 Alaska earthquake (Roy et al., 2022)
            or the 1976 Friuli earthquake (Rollins et al., 2020), to determine
            the capacity term. Furthermore, this method has been applied to
            recent earthquakes, such as the 2016 Ecuador earthquake (Lopez et
            al., 2018) or the 2010 Haiti earthquake (Olson et al., 2011), where
            surface manifestations of gravelly soil liquefaction were observed.
            Inspired by Cao et al. (2013), global assessments have been
            conducted recently by researchers (Rollins et al., 2021 and Pirhadi
            et al., 2022), utilizing case histories that include DPT
            measurements. Moreover, various researchers have conducted
            laboratory experiments to understand the liquefaction phenomenon in
            gravelly soils (Chang et al., 2014, Chang and Phantachang, 2016,
            etc.). Within the scope of this study, a protocol is implemented to
            assess the 65 DPT-based case histories. Using maximum likelihood
            methodology, probabilistic-based seismic soil liquefaction
            triggering curves are proposed.

          <h2>Case History Database</h2>
          <p>
            The newly proposed database inspired by the existing literature
            consists of 4 different earthquakes with magnitudes ranging between
            6.5 to 9.2. A summary table showing the earthquakes included in the
            database is presented in Table 1.
          </p>
          <img src="/images/table-1.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            As can be shown from the gradation curves presented in Figure 1, the
            soil profiles are mainly consisting of gravelly soils either
            gravelly sands or sandy gravels. The statistics of the gradation
            characteristics for the case histories are summarized in Table 2.
          </p>
          <img src="/images/fig-1.png" alt="" />
          <p>
            Based on the gradation characteristics, the susceptibility of soil
            layers is assessed, and the loosest fully saturated soil layer is
            chosen as the critical layer. Subsequently, a protocol is developed
            for the selected critical layer to conduct an unbiased screening for
            all the case histories. This case history evaluation protocol is
            divided into 'load' and 'capacity' terms.

            Determination of Resistance Term – Site Investigation 
          </h3>
          <p>
            To characterize the stiffness and density states of the soil at the
            site, the DPT apparatus has been chosen to obtain an unbiased
            resistance term. This apparatus consists of a larger cone with a
            diameter of 74 mm and an apex angle of 60 degrees, which is larger
            than that used in CPT, generating greater energy with a 120 kg
            hammer dropped from a height of 100 cm, in contrast to the SPT
            apparatus. These conditions allow for obtaining unbiased results,
            especially in gravelly soils. During the test, the number of blows
            is counted at 10 cm intervals and recorded as DPT blow counts (Cao
            et al., 2013).

            N120 is defined as the cumulative blow counts for a 30 cm
            penetration of the cone. Similar to the SPT procedure, corrections
            based on energy levels and normalization due to overburden pressure
            must be applied to the DPT-Nin-situvalues. The conventional DPT
            system has an average hammer energy efficiency ratio of 89%
            (EDPT,avg). For all the case histories, a Pile Driving Analyzer
            (PDA) device is used to capture various hammer energy measurements
            (EDPT) during the test. It's worth noting that variations in the
            energy measurements are attributed to the variability in the rate of
            hammer drop (Cao et al., 2012). In-situ DPT-N values (Nin-situ) are
            corrected for energy efficiency following a similar procedure used
            in SPT (Rollins et al., 2021), as described in Equation 1.

            To address the “capacity” term in each case history, simplified
            procedure proposed by Seed and Idriss (1971) for Cyclic Stress Ratio
            (CSR) term is used, as given in Equation 3.

            To assess the intensity of shaking levels, we implement
            event-specific ShakeMaps from the U.S. Geological Survey. We
            estimate the amax value for a hypothetical 'rock' site based on the
            rupture distance of the case history site. According to
            supplementary documentation from the USGS, this 'rock' site has a
            Vs,30 of 760 m/s. Using the soil classification suggested by Seed et
            al. (1997), we correct the amax value for the specific soil site of
            the case history.

            Development of Probabilistic Liquefaction Curves
          </h2>
          <p>
            Developing a database and processing case histories represent some
            of the most challenging aspects of liquefaction studies, often
            requiring the researcher's judgment. In recent years, various
            approaches have been developed by numerous researchers to create
            liquefaction triggering correlations for gravelly soils (Cao et al.,
            2013; Rollins et al., 2021 and 2022; Pirhadi et al., 2022). The
            aforementioned case history database is employed to develop
            liquefaction triggering correlations using the Maximum Likelihood
            Estimation (MLE) method, following the protocol suggested by Cetin
            (2000), which outlines specific formulations in detail. MLE shares a
            common goal with multidimensional "regression" analyses but offers
            advantages, such as a more appropriate treatment of aleatory
            uncertainties for separate contributing sources and the ability to
            monitor model parameters, including their interactions and
            covariances. The selection of a limit state function is of paramount
            importance when assessing overburden correction (Kσ), duration
            correction (), and grain size characteristics like gravel content
            (GC) within a unified framework. As part of the Maximum Likelihood
            Assessment, a limit state function described in Equation 6 is
            chosen, taking into account parameters suggested by Cetin et al.
            (2018). MLE enables the simultaneous assessment of liquefaction
            triggering relationships along with these corrections.

          <p>
            Assessment to maximize the likelihood function has been performed
            however  and is concluded to be “0” which indicates no importance
            for the model. On the other hand, it should be noted that grain size
            characteristics play a crucial role in seismic soil liquefaction and
            with increasing number of data points, gravel content is believed to
            contribute more in probabilistic efforts. Accordingly,  and  is
            excluded and the efforts are continued with the formulation

            all at once with the aim to maximize the likelihood function
            presented in Equation 7 and 8. Final recommended relationships for
            seismic soil liquefaction triggering are presented in Equation 8 and

            presented in Figure 2. A comparison between the suggested model by
            Rollins et al. (2021) and this study is presented in Figure 3. The
            difference between the models is attributed to the use of different
            database and number of case history data points included in the
            specific database.

          <h2>Summary and Conclusions</h2>
          <p>
            This study presents a seismic soil liquefaction database
            specifically for gravelly soils, utilizing dynamic penetration test
            (DPT) results. The assessment protocol outlines the steps taken for
            each case history to ensure an unbiased screening process.
            Additionally, the study highlights the significance of grain size
            effects in selecting the site investigation method, leading to the
            investigation of new case histories using the grain size effect-free
            DPT method. The study employs maximum likelihood models to assess
            the initiation of seismic soil liquefaction, resulting in the
            development of new liquefaction boundary curves. These new models
            offer improvements in the engineering assessment of the probability
            of seismic soil liquefaction initiation. The study addresses three
            key factors: i) magnitude (duration) effects, ii) gravel content
            (GC), and iii) effective overburden pressure effects. The maximum
            likelihood estimation (MLE) model demonstrates that GC content has a
            lesser impact compared to other parameters, leading to its exclusion
            from the modeling efforts. The final model establishes an unbiased
            foundation for evaluating liquefaction initiation, encompassing
            overall uncertainties. Comparison of these models underscores the
            challenge posed by the lack of case history data for gravelly soils,
            hindering probabilistic modeling efforts. Increasing the number of
            available case histories will be instrumental in enhancing modeling
            efforts, enabling engineers in practical applications to incorporate
            these insights into their projects.
